# YouCal Remastered

YouTrack + iCal = YouCal

Inspired by YouTrack Due Day Calendar, export YouTrack Issue Due to iCal so that other calendar services can subscribe through iCalendar, using [iCal4j](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j) library.

This repo is the remastered version of the original idea from [youcal](https://github.com/sshipway/youcal)
